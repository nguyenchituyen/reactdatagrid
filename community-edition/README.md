## ReactDataGrid Community Edition

This is the **Community Edition** of **`ReactDataGrid`**.

The **Community Edition** is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/inovua/reactdatagrid/blob/master/community-edition/LICENSE.md).

For the **Enterprise Edition** please see [this page](https://github.com/inovua/reactdatagrid/blob/master/enterprise-edition/README.md).

## Installation & Getting Started

Installing the **`ReactDataGrid` Community Edition** is as easy as:

```sh
$ npm install @inovua/reactdatagrid-community --save
```

See the [documentation getting started page](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs) for more details.

## TypeScript support

**`ReactDataGrid`** ships with `TypeScript` definition files so it's fully integrated with your preferred editor to help with autocompletion and type-safety.

## Features

**`ReactDataGrid`** is packed with all the functionality you would expect from an enterprise-grade grid.

As stated before, **`ReactDataGrid`** is built with **`React`** in mind, so it supports popular patterns in the **`React`** world: controlled/uncontrolled props, render props, built with immutability in mind etc.

Here's a list of the features that we support in the **Community Edition**:

- [Remote data source](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/getting-started#using-async-or-remote-data)
- [Sorting](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/sorting)
- [Pagination](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/pagination)
- [Inline edit with custom editor support](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/inline-edit)
- [Filtering with built in filters](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/filtering)
- [Stacked columns](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/stacking-columns)
- [Context menu integration](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/context-menu-integration)
- [Rowspan and colspan](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/cell-rowspan-and-colspan)
- [Row selection](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/row-selection)
- [Cell selection](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/cell-selection)
- [Keyboard navigation](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/keyboard-navigation)
- [Customizing rows, cells and headers](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/customizing-cells-rows-headers)
- [Scroll customization](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/scrolling-and-scroll-customization)
- [RTL support](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/rtl-support)
- [Beautiful themes](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/styling-and-theming#themes)
- [Column reorder](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/api-reference#props-reorderColumns)
- [Column resize](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/api-reference#props-resizable)

Besides the above, there's a lot more backed into the **Enterprise Edition**, so make sure you explore [our documentation](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs).

## Documentation

We're heavily invested into our [documentation](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs) - it ships with full working examples and a live editor. Each prop **`ReactDataGrid`** supports has it's own description and usage example.

Additionally, each feature is clearly presented and has a dedicated page that explains the feature and shows examples of real-life usage. See for example [sorting](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/sorting), [filtering](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/filtering), [pagination](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/pagination) etc.

## Examples

```tsx
import React from 'react';

  { name: 'age', header: 'Age', maxWidth: 1000, defaultFlex: 1 },
];

const gridStyle = { minHeight: 550 };

const dataSource = [
