          When we started building the toolkit, we've made a checklist of
          features that our components need to include out-of-the-box:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Performance</b> - a component is only useful if it does its job
            quickly. This will generally not be a problem with smaller
            components like buttons, dialogs, color pickers, etc - but menus,
            lists and grids need a lot of performance considerations in order to
            be really snappy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  };

  const width = props.width !== undefined ? props.width : '100%';
  return (
    <Panel
      {...props}
      style={{ maxWidth: width }}
      bodyStyle={{ paddingTop: 30 }}
      renderTitleBar={() => props.children}
      renderBody={renderBody}
      bodyScrollable={true}
    />
  );
};
