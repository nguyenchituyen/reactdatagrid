1.2 Depending on the Licensee’s order and the corresponding fees paid to the Licensor, the Licensee is granted a Single Application License or a Multiple Applications License. The Licensee must acquire the same type of License (Single Application License or Multiple Applications Licenses) for all his Licensed Developers, the Licensor does not grant the possibility to buy for certain Licensed Developers a Single Application License and for others a Multiple Applications License.

**1.3 This is a license agreement and not an agreement for sale.**

1.4 For the avoidance of doubt, React components vendors are not allowed to use the Software without the express written permission of Inovua Trading S.R.L. and if you or the company you represent is a React components vendor, in order to purchase a license for or use the Software you first have to contact Inovua Trading S.R.L. and obtain its written approval.
This License is not granted and to any Licensee that is a software developer (person or company) acting as an outsourcing software developer, in this situation the Software can be used by such developer only in case his client is a Licensee who holds a valid License and only for the exclusive development of the Licensee’s Integrated Products in accordance with the terms and conditions of this EULA.

1.5 The Licensee needs a License for each Licensed Developer that uses the Software for development activities. The licenses are not nominal and can be used by any of the Licensed Developers, so long as the Software is not being used simultaneously for development purposes at any given time by more Licensed Developers than Licensee has seats/licenses.
If the Licensee’s testing team need to compile the application, then those testers will also each need a license. Testers who just test the completed, compiled application (as an end-user does) do not need a license.
Inovua Trading S.R.L. does not license per machine, per server, or demand any royalties or run-time fees.
If no development is performed on a build machine or build server and its sole purpose is to generate actual builds of the Licensee’s Integrated Products, then the Licensee does not need to purchase a separate license for the build machine. If, however, a Licensed Developer uses the build machine for active development and this developer does not have a valid license for the Software/products, then the Licensee must acquire a License for the Software.

1.6 In addition, for the entire **subscription period of 12 months** from the date the Licensee purchased a commercial License to use the Software, the Licensee will receive **minor and major updates for the Software and support services**, within a maximum of 10 tickets with response in 3 business days calculated starting with the next business day from the ticket issuance.
The Licensee understands and agrees that updates supplement and/or replace and may disable the former version of the Software. The resulting updated Software may be used only in the same conditions of the purchased commercial License.
The Licensee understands and agrees that updates provided to the Licensee according to this Agreement may include new software which may be governed by additional terms and conditions to which the Licensee must agree before downloading or using these updates in any way.

1.7 Upon expiration of a subscription, the Licensee can optionally renew the License for an additional 12 months and that receive another year of updates. Renewal costs/fees will be determined at the date of renewal. If the Licensee does not renew his subscription, he may continue to use the products he has licensed (the last version of the Software he obtained/licensed during the validity of his subscription), but **he will no longer be entitled to use new updates/versions of the Software released by the Licensor after the expiry of his subscription or be eligible for technical support services from Inovua Trading S.R.L.**. Consequently, in case the Licensee uses a version of the Software that was released by the Licensor after the expiry of his subscription the Licensee will have the right to use that version for the sole purpose of evaluating its functionality and performance and he will not be allowed to integrate that version of the Software into end products or use it for any commercial, productive or training purpose.

Although Inovua Trading S.R.L. does not claim any ownership rights in the Licensee’s Integrated Products, any modifications the Licensee or its Licensed Developers performs to the Software source code will be the exclusive property of Inovua Trading S.R.L..

1.10 The Licensor will make available the Software in **source code** form. In case you do not acquire and pay a commercial License ("Single Application License" or "Multiple Applications License"), _you can use the Software for free_, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, _for the sole purpose of evaluating its functionality and performance and you are not allowed to integrate the Software into end products or use it for any commercial, productive or training purpose_.
