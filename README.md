## Purpose

We've set out to build the best **React Data Grid** written specifically with **`React`** in mind.

## Problem

We know other solutions exist out there, but we find they have one or multiple of the following problems:

- are just thin wrappers around **`React`** - more like an after-thought;
- are too bloated;
- are not extensible and easy to use;
- don't have enterprise-grade features;
- lack of documentation.

## Solution

We've poured our soul into **`ReactDataGrid`** and built it from scratch with **`React`** in mind.

There are 2 editions of the **`ReactDataGrid`** that we're releasing:

- **Community Edition** - includes the core functionality most people actually use in their products ([MIT License](./community-edition/LICENSE.md));
- **Enterprise Edition** - includes advanced functionality, especially targeted for enterprise apps ([Commercial License](./enterprise-edition/LICENSE.md)).

Both editions of the **`ReactDataGrid`** are published and available in the public **npm** registry.

## Installation & Getting Started

**`ReactDataGrid`** is distributed via **npm**. So getting started is as easy as:

```sh
$ npm install @inovua/reactdatagrid-community --save
```

or if you want to evaluate the **Enterprise Edition**

```sh
$ npm install @inovua/reactdatagrid-enterprise --save
```

See the [documentation getting started page](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs) for more details.

## TypeScript support

**`ReactDataGrid`** ships with **`TypeScript`** definition files, so it's fully integrated with your preferred editor to help with autocompletion and type-safety.

## Features

**`ReactDataGrid`** is packed with all the functionality you would expect from an enterprise-grade grid.

As stated before, the **`ReactDataGrid`** is built with **`React`** in mind, so it supports popular patterns in the **`React`** world: controlled/uncontrolled props, render props, built with immutability from the ground up etc.

Here's a list of the features that we support for each edition:

### Community Edition features

Besides the above, there's a lot more backed into the **`ReactDataGrid`**, so make sure you explore [our documentation](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs).

## Evaluating and using the Enterprise Edition

The **Enterprise Edition** is a commercial product and it requires a commercial license - please visit [the pricing page](https://reactdatagrid.io/pricing) for more details. Once you buy a license, we'll provide you a license key, so you can start using the **`ReactDataGrid` Enterprise Edition** in your apps.

You are free to evaluate the **Enterprise Edition** of the **`ReactDataGrid`** even without a license key - all the features are available and ready to use, but a license notice will be displayed initially for a few seconds. If you want to remove that, you can [contact us](mailto:contact@reactdatagrid.io) and we'll send you an evaluation license key which you can use for 30 days.

Please note you are not allowed to integrate the **Enterprise Edition** of the **`ReactDataGrid`** into end products or use it for any commercial, productive or training purpose without a valid commercial license. Read [EULA](./enterprise-edition/LICENSE.md) for more details.

After you purchase and receive your commercial license key, you have to set it in the `licenseKey` prop then you can start using the **`ReactDataGrid`** in development and production.

```tsx
import ReactDataGrid from '@inovua/reactdatagrid-enterprise';
import '@inovua/reactdatagrid-enterprise/index.css';

<ReactDataGrid licenseKey="..." />;
```

Even without a license key, all features are unlocked so you can evaluate the **`ReactDataGrid`** and decide whether you need the **Community Edition** or the **Enterprise Edition**.

## Documentation

We're heavily invested into our [documentation](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs) - it ships with full working examples and a live editor. Each prop **`ReactDataGrid`** supports has it's own description and usage example.

Additionally, each feature is clearly presented and has a dedicated page that explains the feature and shows examples of real-life usage. See for example [sorting](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/sorting), [filtering](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/filtering), [grouping](https://reactdatagrid.io/docs/grouping-rows) etc.

## Examples

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDataGrid from '@inovua/reactdatagrid-enterprise';
import '@inovua/reactdatagrid-enterprise/index.css';

const columns = [
  { name: 'name', header: 'Name', minWidth: 50, defaultFlex: 2 },
  { name: 'age', header: 'Age', maxWidth: 1000, defaultFlex: 1 },
];

const gridStyle = { minHeight: 550 };

const dataSource = [
  { id: 1, name: 'John McQueen', age: 35 },
  { id: 2, name: 'Mary Stones', age: 25 },
  { id: 3, name: 'Robert Fil', age: 27 },
  { id: 4, name: 'Roger Robson', age: 81 },
  { id: 5, name: 'Billary Konwik', age: 18 },
  { id: 6, name: 'Bob Martin', age: 18 },
  { id: 7, name: 'Matthew Richardson', age: 54 },
  { id: 8, name: 'Ritchie Peterson', age: 54 },
  { id: 9, name: 'Bryan Martin', age: 40 },
  { id: 10, name: 'Mark Martin', age: 44 },

  { id: 16, name: 'Robert Carlson', age: 31 },
  { id: 17, name: 'Johny Perterson', age: 40 },
];

export default () => (
  <ReactDataGrid
    idProperty="id"
    columns={columns}
    dataSource={dataSource}
    style={gridStyle}
  />
);
```
