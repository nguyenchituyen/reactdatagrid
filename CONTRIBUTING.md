## Contributing to ReactDataGrid Community Edition

We generally accept and welcome contributions such as bug fixes, optimizations, small improvements. However, we do not currently accept contributions for new features.

Before contributing, you have to sign our CLA - a bot will make sure you have it signed.

## Contributing to ReactDataGrid Enterprise Edition

For the moment we do not accept contributions to the **Enterprise Edition**.

## Got a question or problem?

Please don't open issues for support questions. If you're using the Enterprise Edition, use our dedicated [support portal](https://reactdatagrid.freshdesk.com) instead. GitHub issues should only be filled for bug reports and feature requests. If you need community support, post your question to [Stack Overflow - tag: reactdatagrid](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactdatagrid)

We will be closing all issues which are general support questions.

## Found a bug?

If you just found a bug in our code, let us know by [submitting a Github issue](https://github.com/inovua/reactdatagrid/issues/new).

## Missing a feature?

New feature requests are accepted - [file an issue for that](https://github.com/inovua/reactdatagrid/issues/new).

## Submission guidelines

Before submitting a new issue, please make sure it's not already been raised. If the issue is not already submitted, please make sure you fully describe it, include any relevant information (which edition you're using, which version, etc) and also create a minimal code example which can be run standalone - either github repo or [codesandbox](codesandbox.io). Issues without a minimal reproduction code will be closed.
